      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p><i>3008</i> is a roblox game/experience by game developer uglyburger0, who also created the game's excellent soundtrack. The game takes inspiration from SCP-3008, a fictional group of entities
        consisting of SCP-3008-1 (the infinite IKEA store) and SCP-3008-2 (the faceless IKEA employees). The layout of the main map, shown above, is clearly based off the real-life swedish furniture store IKEA. 
        Some of the items in the game even mirror its IKEA counterparts, which adds a nice touch of realism. The main objective of the game is to survive for as many nights as you can (and possibly make a base too), because the store is made dangerous 
        because of the faceless and deformed employees walking around. Its description says:</p>
      <blockquote><i>"Welcome to 3008, the unusually large furniture store. Wander through the vast horror land of home hardware located within the 3008-1. Build a base, survive from employees."</i></blockquote>
      <p>
        The game became popular during the pandemic, with a lot of people, including me, playing it with their friends almost every day. This is due to its fun mechanics, such as base-building, food and resource collecting, and pushing the employees away.
        Many youtubers also began playing it, contributing even more to its already growing popularity.
