            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                <i>3008</i> is a roblox game/experience by game developer uglyburger0, who also created the game's excellent soundtrack. The game takes inspiration from SCP-3008, a fictional group of entities
                consisting of SCP-3008-1 (the infinite IKEA store) and SCP-3008-2 (the faceless IKEA employees). The layout of the main map, shown above, is clearly based off the real-life swedish furniture store IKEA. 
                Some of the items in the game even mirror its IKEA counterparts, which adds a nice touch of realism. The main objective of the game is to survive for as many nights as you can (and possibly make a base too), because the store is made dangerous 
                because of the faceless and deformed employees walking around. Its description says:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>"Welcome to 3008, the unusually large furniture store. Wander through the vast horror land of home hardware located within the 3008-1. Build a base, survive from employees."</i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The game became popular during the pandemic, with a lot of people, including me, playing it with their friends almost every day. This is due to its fun mechanics, such as base-building, food and resource collecting, and pushing the employees away
                while watching them ragdoll on the floor. Many youtubers also began playing it, contributing even more to its already growing popularity. Below is an example of such gameplay videos.

            <h3>Mechanics</h3>
            <h4>Basics</h4>
            <p>
              When the game is started, there will be three health bars: energy, hunger, and health. All can be replenished by food items, but certain foods,
              such as the 1 liter soda, will decrease health. Energy is depleted by running or throwing items, hunger is depleted by not eating enough, and 
              health is depleted by either hunger or damage. The player can pick up and place objects down to their liking, and also collect food and medkits 
              scattered around the IKEA. Players can only hold up to 16 items in their inventory at a time. If the player dies, they will respawn in a random 
              place in the IKEA. To remember where their base is, they can also put down waypoints to help them set a navigation point if ever they get lost in the infinite store.
            </p>
            <h4>Day-Night Cycles</h4>
            <p>
                In 3008, there exists a day and night cycle, with another "harder" variation for both. Day and night cycles last about five minutes each. Before it turns day or night,
                the player will hear ticking sounds in the background at the last ten seconds, getting louder as the night or day draws closer. So that the players don't feel anxious 
                about the time when a day or night will end, a <b>personal watch gamepass</b> is available for purchase in the 3008 game store, for only 8 robux.
            </p>

              <p> 
                  The <b>normal day</b> cycle allows the player to freely collect resources and build their base out of the 
                  surrounding items in the several IKEA showcases and storage shelves that can be found around the map, such 
                  as pallets, beds, tables, and more. During the day, happy, store-like music loops in the background, being different for
                  different days of the week (Monday, Tuesday,... Sunday). However, the <b>foggy day</b> cycle makes the employees remain hostile
                  without you being able to push them away unlike in the night, forcing you to be more careful when collecting 
                  resources. The music also changes to a slightly more tense theme. Foggy day occurs every 15 days or has a 1/100 chance of occurring.

              <img src="../asset/Night_Icon.png" alt="3008 during a normal night" title="Nighttime, 3008" width="200px" length="200px">
              <img src="../asset/Blood_Night_Icon.png" alt="3008 during a blood night" title="Blood night, 2008" width="200px" length="200px">
              <p>
                The <b>normal night</b> cycle is when the faceless employees become hostile and start attacking the players. Luckily,
                if the player has a base without any gaps for entrance of the employees, it's alright! The players is completely safe. If, 
                somehow, the player is caught in a goose chase with an employee, they gain the ability to push them away, which will stun
                the employees for about a few seconds. During the night, the soundtrack played is a creepy ambience. However, the <b>blood night</b> cycle makes the employees more agile than normal, and also 
                make them sense players from much farther away as well, making it much more dangerous to explore at night than it already is. It 
                also has a dramatic entrance, as instead of just the lights turning off, a faint scream sound plays, and the entire IKEA appears to have a red tint as well.
                The background music during a bloody night is more intense as well. A bloody night occurs once every 10 days, or with a 1/20 chance of occurring.
